# SECRecordScraper
A final project for a python course I took during my study at Auburn.
It is a command line application and is intended as a quick-lookup for an SEC football/basketball team's record.

### Features
  * Program will request a team, year, and sport. 
  * Will error check to verify that correct inputs were made.
  * Scrapes webpage and then parses the HTML for useful data.
  * Uses tKinter to have a popup display for the user.
  
### Libraries Used
 * Requests
 * BeautifulSoup
 * Pandas
 * tkinter
 
### Insights on potential improvements
  * Would make use of classes and objects to allow for easier flow of code and less jumble in main program.
  * Would include all NCAA Division 1 schools.
  * Would create a GUI interface for easier user accessibility.
  
This application was made to cover the scopes of all the topics covered in the python course, and to introduce myself to web scraping for data collection.
