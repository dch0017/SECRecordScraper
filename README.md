# SECRecordScraper
A final project for a python course I took during my study at Auburn
It is a command line application is intended as a quick-lookup for an SEC football/basketball team's record.

## Features:
 * Program will request a team, year, and sport. 
 * Will error check to verify that correct inputs were made.
 * Scrapes webpage and then parses the HTML for useful data.
 * Uses tKinter to have a popup display for the user.


This application was made to cover the scopes of all the topics covered in the python course, and to introduce myself to web scraping for data collection.
